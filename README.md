# students_details

To create a student details app using CRUD operations with BLoC in Flutter, you would first need to define the data model for a student. This would include properties such as name, age, and grade. Next, you would create a BLoC class to handle state management and data retrieval. The BLoC class would use streams to communicate with the UI and provide methods for handling CRUD operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records.

In the UI, you would use widgets such as TextField and RaisedButton to gather user input and trigger CRUD operations via the BLoC class. When the user enters data, the TextField would update the state in the BLoC, and when the user clicks a button, the corresponding CRUD operation would be triggered.

Overall, using the BLoC pattern for managing state in a student details app can provide a clean and efficient way to handle CRUD operations and ensure that the UI remains responsive and up-to-date.
